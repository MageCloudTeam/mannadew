They taste way better than normal pastries even though they are GF. Regarding the service, it was spectacular! When I picked them up, the team were all smiley, welcoming, helpful, and decent. Would definitely order again and again, especially for picnics, brunch, or breakfast. You guys are missing out big time if you haven’t tried Manna Dew yet!<br\/><\/p>",
